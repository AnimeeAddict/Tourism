            <p class="textie">It is important for young adults when they visit a country to make sure they respect their
                cultures and traditions. In South Korea, Confucianism’s ideas still heavily influence their culture.
                Britannica says that they emphasize respect for ancestors, age, and seniority for their family, work,
                and social life. Economic status and position in a business hierarchy, age and marital status are among
                the determinants of relative seniority, and there is some expectation that even between social
                acquaintances are other factors that can influence relationships. In traditional Korean culture, the
                spirits of the deceased do not leave the earth for several generations, which is why parents and
                grandparents who have passed away are still considered part of the family. There are ancestral rites
                that are performed to honor them on their death anniversaries and on major holidays like Lunar New Year
                and Harvest Moon Festival (also known as Korean Thanksgiving). These holiday celebrations include
                formal, respectful greeting of elders, the preparation and eating of special foods, and wearing
                traditional dresses(hanbok). Respecting a country by understanding their traditions and cultures are
                crucial to young adults. </p>

            <p class="textie">Before visiting South Korea, knowing the history would be very helpful to those who are
                between the ages 18 to 29 since being respectful is very important to their culture. South Korea
                originally formed from the several surrounding kingdoms unifying into one country. According to History,
                they were able to maintain Korean political and cultural independence for thousands of years during the
                Choson Dynasty. After surviving Japan’s invasion, they stayed isolated for about 250 years with only a
                few of their citizens traveling outside of their country. However, during the 20th century, Japan,
                China, and Russia fought to try and gain control over Korea. Japan was victorious so for the next 35
                years, Japan wanted to make Korean culturally Japanese by trying to wipe out their distinctive language
                and cultural identity. This period is known as the Colonial Period. When Japan was defeated in 1945, the
                United States and Soviet Union divided Korea into two separate zones. History says that in August 1948,
                the pro-U.S. Republic of Korea (South Korea) was led by the anti-communist Syngman Rhee which was
                established in Seoul. Since they separated, South Korea declared their independence which made North
                Korea who had China and the Soviet Union on their side to try and invade to regain control over all of
                South Korea. The United States and United Nation fought alongside the South Koreans in this war which
                ended in 1953 and cost two million lives. After learning the history, young adults like to visit and see
                what that country is like after what happened to them in the past.</p>
