                When someone thinks of China, some think only about their food and dances; however, there’s much more to
                China than just what’s on the surface. Britcanna states that China, located in Asia, stretches 3,250
                miles from east to west and 3,400 miles
                from north to south. It’s bordered by Mongolia in the north; Russia and North Korea in the northeast;
                Vietnam, Laos, Burma, India, Bhutan, and Nepal to the west. South Korea and Japan are across the Yellow
                Sea which lies to the east of China. The Philippines lay beyond the South China Sea in the southeast.
                The temperatures in this area generally decrease south to north and around April, the mean temperature
                is above freezing for the whole place. </h2>

            <h2> Britcanna expresses that back in the Han dynasty, there were a total of around 13.7 million people
                inhabiting China. When sanitation and hygiene items became more widely produced, China had trouble
                keeping its population in check. Around 1962, contraceptives and late marriages were being promoted. By
                1979, a law of having only one child was implemented and since then their population has dropped
                drastically.</h2>

            <h2>Since the 1990s, China has always had a good and balanced trade cycle. Prior to the war with communists
                countries, they maintained relatively good relations with them for trading, after the war, their
                relationship diminished. China instead built more relationships with noncommunist communities and as of
                today, Hong Kong is one of its most prominent partners in domestic trade. Most of the imports include
                things like chemicals, fuels, and machinery. To export their items out, they use the means of railways
                and waterways. Along the coastlines of China are ports or harbors which extend in two directions, north
                and south. Shanghai used to be the leading port in the 19th century until 1977 when Hong Kong took over.

            <h2> The Translation Company mentions that some major cities in China include Shanghai, Beijing, and Hong
                Kong. Shanghai has the largest population in all of China and is a center for world technology, finance,
                fashion, and culture. Beijing contains a bunch of railways, roads, architecture, palaces, stone gates
                and temples. Hong Kong holds importance to the government as the special administrative regions (SAR) is
                located there and is run under different policies than mainland China. In these cities are also places
                people can visit to pass time and shop. Shanghai and Beijing, for example, have old ruins of palaces and
                temples while other regions have shopping centers.

            <h2> Lastly, according to Britcanna, in Chinese culture writing, dances, and music hold high importance to
                them. Bronze bells represent rewards while dances and rituals provide a structure for activities and
                festivals. Beijing is also known to be China’s cultural center as it holds the Chinese Academy of
                Sciences and several research institutes. Since the 1905s, new architectural discoveries from the past
                have been recovered and put into local museums. The most notable is the Shaanxi province which preserves
                the bodies of the terracotta warriors, horses, and chariots. Chinese cuisine can be organized in terms
                of Daoist principles; Hot is balanced by cold, spicy by mild, and fresh by cured. They tend to celebrate
                some of their own festivals and holidays like the Lantern festival, Spring festival, New Year’s day, and
                the Mid-Autumn Festival. After reading through, hopefully those wanting to explore China have enjoyed
                learning more about their culture, foods, and history.</h2>
