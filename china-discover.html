            <h2> Young adults exploring China during the month of February should consider attending the night of the
                Lantern Festival. The Lantern Festival is an everlasting celebration still carried on today, it’s
                celebrated by people of all ages on the 15th day of the first month of the Lunar Calendar. People of any
                age interested in releasing their own lantern and having a fun night should attend this eventful
                celebration.
                According to CLI , there are two different origin stories of which the first story tells about Emperor
                Ming of the Han dynasty, who demanded its people light lanterns to honor the great Buddhas. The second
                story tells of the Jade emperor who lost his crane to the villagers and decided to slaughter them. His
                daughter, feeling remorse for them, warned them of his plans. The villagers set fireworks, lit fires,
                and hung lanterns to trick the Jade Emperor; thus, they were saved. The Lantern Festival is also linked
                with love and Valentine’s day. On this day, the curfew for people was lifted to go and see the lanterns.
                This festive day entails many sights to see. According to China Highlights, people can go out to see
                lantern displays, riddles written on lanterns, eat Tangyuan (a rice flour dessert filled with a sweet
                paste), watch lion and dragon dances, and see fireworks being lit.
                The Lantern Festival (which falls on the 15th of February) is definitely a sight to see. Teenagers and
                adults looking for a night full of colors, dances, great desserts, and the calming sight of releasing
                lanterns into the night sky are encouraged to attend this festive event. Any young adults out there
                looking for a good time should indefinitely join them for this night.

                <h2 class="car"> Falling in the month of September is the Mid-Autumn Festival, on this day full of festivals and
                    heart-warming events, young adults should most definitely return home to their families. The
                    Mid-Autumn festival is an important family tradition that falls around the 15th day of the 8th month
                    of the Lunar Calendar. The Mid-Autumn festival is also known as the Moon or Mooncake festival. It is
                    a time for family reunions and is celebrated by several other Asian communities. During this time of
                    the year, adults and college students go home in order to celebrate with their families.
                    According to China Highlights, the Mid-Autumn festival came from the legend of Chang’e. Her lover,
                    Huoyi, was given an elixir he refused to take, and thus Chang’e protected it. One day when Huoyi
                    wasn’t home, someone had come to drink the elixir without his knowledge. In an attempt to protect
                    it, Chang’e had no choice but to drink it. She, after taking the elixir, floated to heaven and now
                    lives on the moon with her rabbit. During the Mid-Autumn festival, people set out mooncakes, snacks,
                    fruits, and a pair of candles to worship her. In return, she grants them their wishes. In China, the
                    full moon (specifically on the day of the Mid-Autumn festival) is a big part of their culture. It
                    symbolizes family reunions, and during this full moon, it shines the brightest and is the most
                    beautiful. According to CLI, this festival dates all the way back to the Shang dynasty. It later got
                    more attention during the Tang dynasty and amongst a lot of women. The moon is associated with
                    fertility and can represent a pregnant woman.
                    In Chinese, the Mid-Autumn festival translates directly to the “middle autumn festival” and entails
                    many wonderful events and foods. According to CLI, people eat mooncakes on this day which are very
                    diverse depending on which part of China you are in. The different flavors or fillings included are
                    meats, fruits, savory flavors, and some on the sweeter side. People also hang up lanterns as both a
                    sign of fertility and to guide the spirits in the afterlife. Traditionally, the mooncakes are
                    homemade and enjoyed with a cup of tea sitting under the full moon with family.
                    People of any age and any race are free to participate. On this day, most would take some time off
                    and visit their loved ones. They would go home, and under the shimmer of the full moon, sit down
                    with a cup of tea and enjoy the mooncakes with family. After being away for such a long time, the
                    familiar faces of friends and family bring comfort. Young adults finding themselves in China during
                    September should consider partaking in such a festive day in which they spend with those closest to
                    them.
