            <h2>Transportation Options</h2>
            <p>For young adults looking to travel to China, there are many factors like how to get there, lodging, and
                in-country transportation to consider. After reading through, tourists headed to China should have a
                rough idea of how it’s going to be. According to China Travel, the transportation methods throughout
                China since the 1990s have gotten better. Airlines in China offer comfortable seating and services for
                travelers; additionally, There are around 244 international airlines in which the most popular being
                Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. In some major Chinese cities, there are 72/144 hour visa free policies
                in which a visa isn’t needed to enter or remain in-country. In some other cities, there’s no visa
                required anyway like Beijing. According to China Travel and Top China Travel Some reliable airlines in
                China include: Air China International Corporation, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines Co.
                ltd, and Xiamen Airlines. Aside from airlines, there are also in-country transport options like the
                metro, train stations, highway and waterway transportations, buses, and taxis. On the trains, there are
                four classes: Hard- Seat, Soft- Seat, Hard- Sleeper, and Soft- Sleeper. The Hard Seat has around 3-5
                people facing each other and provides little comfort while the Soft Seat provides more comfort and has a
                cleaner environment. The Hard Sleeper has 6 bunks with more people while the Soft-Sleeper has 4 bunks,
                more comfort, and a desk lamp. The expressways and highways make traveling by car more efficient. To use
                the expressways on regular days, fees are charged, but free on holidays. Aside from buses, taxis, and
                trains, there are bikes they can rent in most cities. The next time tourists find themselves looking
                into flying out to China, they should definitely remember these factors.
                A big factor of traveling to a foreign country is where are tourists going to stay? Is it safe? And how
                much is it? Well, after reading this, young adults or anyone reading will have a general idea of how
                they’ll get through in China. In China, as mentioned by Travelistos, hotels can cost around 60 euros
                which equals out to around $68 US dollars. Other alternatives are accommodation houses, called Zhusus,
                located in buildings themselves and can range to 30-60 euros ($33-68). Another option is what they call
                a Hutong, these old houses are modeled after ancient China and range to around 30-50 euros ($39-56).
                Located at the airports are sleep boxes which people can stay for a night and it includes a bed and
                small television. Something to remember is to be careful when traveling in foreign countries and the
                restrooms or rooms may be shared with others. According to Local Adventures, travelers should always
                have their passports, the government in China requires their visas and for it to be registered under the
                local government upon arriving. Having read through, hopefully young adults out there looking for an
                adventure have a general idea of how to get around in China and how it’d be like to stay in-country.
                Lastly, don’t forget to enjoy the stay, celebrate, and have fun.
